welcome to my extra information! i want to get this out of the way first..
</p>
<p align="center">
i ship a lot of things, but there's some that i just physically cannot bring myself to like! this is a matter of personal preference, so if you do come an attack me for this you will be blocked and reported to the ponytown / vrchat moderators!

i despise MOONFLOWER and SHELLVISION / HISTORYCHANNEL with all my being, honest to god. they just don't work in my eyes, and i can't bring myself to like the ships. the concepts themselves are cute, but i just can't stand people who say that it'd be the most canon ship for those characters because it wouldn't be healthy in the slightest for Shelly or Astro.

the ships that i ship are moreso out of logic and what would be healthiest for the characters at hand - i also judge it off of who would be able to deal with people's meltdowns the best. like for example, ruineddesserts (shrimpo x sprout). sprout is VERY capable of dealing with tempermental people, and can easily calm people down due to his nature. sure, some people won't say it's good, but i don't care!

ship what you wan't, i don't care, just don't ship toodles or pebble with anyone.. and don't come up to me saying you ship ginger and cosmo because those two are cannonically cousins. it was said by qwel themselves that they're cousins, so get over yourseleves and stop deluding yourself to make the stupid food based ships happen.

just because it's mainstream doesn't mean that everyone ships it! i ship fruitcake, but that doesn't mean it's my top ship! i prefer caketopper (glisten x cosmo) and perfectdesserts (glisten x sprout) over fruitcake, and will take those two ships over fruitcake any day - hell, i'd even take fruitcookie (ginger x sprout) over fruitcake any day (yes, i ship ginger and sprout already).
